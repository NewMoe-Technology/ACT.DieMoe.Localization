  "helpPanel-cbIdleTimerEnd": "A previously defaulted non-option, ACT can internally count seconds of inactivity instead of waiting on a log timestamp with a time sufficiently after the last combat action.  If disabled, ACT will only end encounters based off of timestamps, and if no new log lines are parsed, its possible to never end an encounter *until* a new log timestamp is seen from EQ2.  When enabled, the timer will not strictly end an encounter based off the timer, but two seconds after (in absense of log timestamps).",

  "helpPanel-cbLongEncDuration": "Previously when only using timed encounter ending, heals being cast while the delay was counting down could affect the encounter's total duration, and therefore ExtDPS.  If unchecked, heals after the last combat action will still be recorded up until the encounter is terminated, but will not affect the duration of the encounter.",
  "helpPanel-cbMiniClickThrough": "When enabled, mouse actions will not affect the Mini Window.  When transparency is set, this allows you to both see through and click on things behind the window.  Of course you can no longer move or close the window by normal means until click-through is disabled.  NOTE: You may toggle this option by right-clicking the main window 'Show Mini' button.",
  "helpPanel-cbMiniColumnAlign": "When enabled, the text export will be aligned into a table where each cell is padded to the length of the longest entry in that column.  The alignment is dependant on the font selected.  It is recommended you use a text formatter such as {NAME10} instead of {name} or that column may have excessive padding.",
  "helpPanel-cbMultiDamageIsOne": "When enabled, an attack that has multiple damage types, such as \"300 crushing, 5 poison and 5 disease damage\" will show up as one total attack: 300/5/5 crushing/poison/disease, internally seen as 310.  If disabled, each damage type will show up as an individual swing, IE three attacks: 300 crushing; 5 poison; 5 disease.  Having a single attack show up as multiple will have consequences when calculating ToHit%.",
  "helpPanel-cbOnlyGraphAllies": "When checked, simple encounter bar graphs will only show your allies.",
  "helpPanel-cbPetIsMaster": "When checked, a pet will not show as its own entry, but as a spell under their master.

Only future encounters will be affected by this setting.\n\n\nSince LU19 and <Purpose tags> showing under a pet's name and not in log files, parsers cannot automatically see who a pet belongs to.",
  "helpPanel-cbRecalcWardedHits": "If enabled, no-damage hits or reduced damage hits immediately following a ward absorbtion will be increased by the absorbtion amount.  Stoneskin's no-damage hits cannot be recalculated.",
  "helpPanel-cbRecordLogs": "When checked, ACT will record all log lines that appear during an encounter.  You may then right click an encounter, select View Logs and view/search through them.  Disabling this option will reduce memory usage by a bit less than 45% when compared to default settings.  Exported ACT files will retain these recorded logs.",
  "helpPanel-cbRestrictToAll": "When checked, under each combatant, the only Damage Types entries that will be fully populated will be the ones marked (Ref) for Reference.  Instead of 'Melee (Out)' showing All, crush, and slash it will only show All, which is a combination of crush/slash.  Crush and slash will still be found under 'All Outgoing (Ref)' due to the (Ref) tag; the listing will simply be more crowded.\nEnabling this options willl reduce CPU usage by a bit less than 10% and reduce memory usage by a bit more than 10% when compared to default settings.  Unchecked, this option will populate all entries in their logical listings.",
  "helpPanel-cbSExpEnd": "If 'You gain experience!' is seen, the encounter will be considered ended. \n('You convert experience into achievement experience!' will also trigger this.)",
  "helpPanel-cbSqlSafeMode": "In safe mode, SQL commands will be sent one at a time and server response checked.  Otherwise commands will be sent in 100 row batches, which while faster will be more problematic to debug.",
  "helpPanel-cbSwarmIsMaster": "When enabled, \"Дух огня (персонажа)\", \"Wässrige Horde des Character\" and other similarly named pets will have their attack damage added to their master instead of as their own named entry.  Incoming attacks will *not* be redirected to their master's data.",
  "helpPanel-cbWebServerEnabled": "The ACT Web Interface is somewhat similar to the EQ2 HTML exports in appearance.  Dissimilarly, the web interface is not made up of intermediary HTML files but generated HTML upon request.  By default, you can see auto-updating pages of the current encounter table, Mini-Window text(with support for multiple presets), spell timers and a page that can browse through all of ACT's encounter data in memory.  Context-menu reports based on that data are not currently available but plugins can be made to expand the web interface.",
  "helpPanel-cbWebServerShowReq": "If enabled, all HTTP requests will be shown.  Otherwise things like auto-updating portions of pages or .css/.js files will be hidden (unless very large).  One request to '/timers'(always shown) may initiate requests to '/ACT.js', '/ACT.css' and '/timers.body'(optionally shown) as well.",
  "helpPanel-cbZoneAllListing": "As the first encounter of each Zone branch, an \"All\" entry can exist which will combine all data from other encounters for that zone.  As encounters progress within that zone, the All entry will be updated in real time.  The All encounter entry will be identical to a merged encounter of all encounters within that zone.\n\nDisabling this option will reduce memory and CPU usage a bit more than 10% when compared to default options.",

  "helpPanel-ddlGraphPriority": "This setting will change the priority of graph generation.  All programs have a priority, usually Normal by default, and this priority defines how much CPU time should be given to the current task.  If set to Lowest(Idle), graph generation will only take CPU time not used by other applications.  If EQ2 is running, this will be next to nothing.  Normal priority will give equal amounts of CPU time to ACT and any other task, such as EQ2. Above Normal(Not recommended) will give graph generation more priority than most other programs and may cause noticable stuttering in EQ2 momentary freezing.  ACT's UI may also become unresponsive during graph generation.",

Once an encounter has taken place, you cannot add or remove combatants  to it without reparsing that battle.

You may then click on the data to review it in the TextBox to the right and either import or delete the entry.\n\nIf you wish to always import data from a particular character, you may enter their name into the TextBox above the yellow ListBox and click the above Add button.  Similarly there is a list of characters to always ignore data from.  You may temporarily disable an accept/reject entry by unchecking it or you may simply use the Remove button on either list.\n\nYou may possibly come across an XML snippet from another source made for this feature.  Instead of having someone send it to you in a tell, you may paste it directly into the larger TextBox above the Import/Delete buttons.  It will then appear as a custom entry allowing you to Import or Delete it.\n\nYou may create a snippet from your own data by going into either the Spell Timers options page or Custom Triggers tab, right-clicking the entry in the list and selecting Copy as Sharable XML.

To add an entry, enter the URL into the labeled TextBox, select an update option and click Add/Edit.  As update options, you can have ACT check but ignore updated files, notify you of updates using a message box or automatically import the external XML file upon detected updates.

The View in browser link will open the URL in your default web browser.\n\nThe Check Now button will on demand check all of the URLs for changes and check-mark the updated files.
